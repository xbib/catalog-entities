This is a Java library for transforming bibliographic data into catalog entities.
Catalog entities are represented as Java classes, which are used to generate RDF graphs from ISO 2709 or MARCXML streams.

In this software, some configurations for MARC, MAB, Pica, UNIMARC are included. To meet certain requirements,
these configurations have to be adjusted.

The RDF graphs can be mapped to arbitray targets, such as Elasticsearch JSON, which was the motivation for this project.
So it is possible to map MARC (or MARC-related formats) to documents with named fields in Elasticsearch JSON,
ready for SRU/CQL searches, using a single JSON configuration file for defining the decoding and mapping of MARC.

The creation of the RDF graphs are in-memory and currently focused on a per-record basis, but this will be enhanced
in future versions. Parallel processing offers high performance - on ordinary hardware, a million MARC records
can be indexed into Elasticsearch per minute.
