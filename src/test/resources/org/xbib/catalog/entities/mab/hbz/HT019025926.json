By showing how the processes of globalization and racialization are interrelated, Zakharov seeks to demonstrate and explore the roles these play in Russia's new nationhood project. The book employs a new threefold theoretical elaboration of racialization, examining the process in terms of 'making', 'doing', and finally 'becoming'. These three elements are considered through discussions of a wide variety of aspects of Russian identity and nationalism, from the analysis of subcultures to explorations of nation-building. Race and Racism in Russia provides important new theories and substantive insights into race and ethnicity in a Russian context, and will be a valuable resource for scholars of Postcolonial Studies, Social Theory and Race\"--"},"SubjectRSWK":[{"subjectGeoName":"Russland","identifierGND":"4076899-5"},{"subjectTopicName":"Nationalismus","identifierGND":"4041300-7"},{"subjectTopicName":"Ethnische Identität","identifierGND":"4153096-2"},{"subjectTopicName":"Rassismus","identifierGND":"4076527-1"},{"subjectChronological":"Geschichte"}],"dc":[{"type":"Monographie"},{"format":"Gedruckte Ressource"},{"date":2015},{"language":"Englisch"}]}
